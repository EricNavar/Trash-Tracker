# Trash Tracker
Trash Tracker is a sort of smart home technology. This program runs on a Raspberry Pi which would be placed in a compartment at the bottom of a trash can. It has a camera pointing out of the trash can so that it can see when someone takes out the trash. Using facial recognition, it remembers who has taken out the trash and gives them a score on a website.

The facial recognition was made with OpenCV and facial recognition libraries. The Website was made with React and Google Material UI. This project won second overall at HackFSU 2019.
